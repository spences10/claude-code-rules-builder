# CLAUDE.md Generator - Updated Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Developers using Claude Code struggle to create effective CLAUDE.md
files that improve their AI assistance experience. This includes both
basic project configuration and sophisticated multi-agent persona
systems that can delegate work to specialized subagents and coordinate
complex development workflows.

## Solution

A sophisticated web-based tool that generates advanced CLAUDE.md files
through a guided interface, supporting both practical project
configuration and multi-agent persona systems for complex development
workflows.

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**

- Individual developers using Claude Code for personal projects
- Development teams standardizing AI-assisted workflows
- Engineering managers seeking to improve team productivity
- Advanced users implementing multi-agent development workflows

**User Personas:**

**"Alex the Adopter"** - Senior developer, early Claude Code user

- Needs: Better Claude responses for their specific tech stack
- Pain: Generic responses don't match their coding standards
- Goal: Generate effective CLAUDE.md for their
  React/TypeScript/Tailwind projects

**"Team Lead Taylor"** - Engineering manager at startup

- Needs: Standardize AI usage across 5-person team
- Pain: Inconsistent AI assistance quality between team members
- Goal: Create shared CLAUDE.md template for team consistency

**"Consultant Casey"** - Freelance developer working across multiple
stacks

- Needs: Quick Claude setup for different client projects
- Pain: Constantly re-explaining context to Claude
- Goal: Template-based quick start for common project types

**"Enterprise Emma"** - Senior architect at large company (NEW)

- Needs: Sophisticated multi-agent workflows with role delegation
- Pain: Complex projects require specialized expertise coordination
- Goal: Create persona systems that delegate work to specialized AI
  agents

## Core Features (Updated)

### 1. Basic Configuration Wizard

- **Project Setup**: Framework, language, project type selection
- **Development Commands**: Essential bash commands (build, test,
  lint)
- **Code Style**: Language-specific formatting and conventions
- **Project Structure**: Key directories and file organization

### 2. Advanced Persona Builder (NEW)

- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Create sophisticated persona systems
- **Role Definition**: Developer, QA, Architect, DevOps, Security
  personas
- **Delegation Rules**: Configure when and how to invoke subagents
- **Communication Protocols**: Set up agent coordination methods
- **Workflow Patterns**: Pre-built multi-agent development processes

### 3. Template Library (Enhanced)

- **Basic Templates**: Popular tech stacks (Next.js, React, Python,
  etc.)
- **Persona Templates**: Advanced multi-agent workflow patterns
- **Real-world Examples**: Based on actual successful CLAUDE.md files
- **Industry Patterns**: BMAD Method, SuperClaude Framework, Agent
  Control Plane

### 4. CLAUDE.md Generation (Enhanced)

- **Basic Mode**: Simple project configuration (25-250 lines)
- **Advanced Mode**: Multi-agent persona systems with subagent
  delegation
- **Hybrid Mode**: Combination of project config and persona systems
- **Validation**: Check against best practices for both modes

### 5. Testing and Simulation (NEW)

- **Persona Flow Testing**: Simulate multi-agent interactions
- **Delegation Validation**: Test subagent communication patterns
- **Workflow Preview**: Visualize agent coordination flows

### 6. Export Options (Enhanced)

- **Direct Download**: Ready-to-use CLAUDE.md file
- **Modular Export**: Separate files for different personas
- **Copy-to-clipboard**: Quick integration
- **Setup Instructions**: How to use with Claude Code subagents

## Technical Architecture (Updated)

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 runes
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with DaisyUI
- **State Management**: Global state with `$state` rune
- **Deployment**: Static hosting compatible
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for drafts and preferences
- **Persona Engine**: Advanced template system for multi-agent
  workflows

## Key Research Insights (Updated)

1. **Personas enable sophisticated multi-agent workflows** - Not just
   instruction sets but technical frameworks for delegation
2. **Claude Code supports up to 10 parallel subagents** - Through Task
   Tool with queuing for 100+ tasks
3. **Real implementations exist** - Agent Control Plane, BMAD Method,
   SuperClaude Framework
4. **Multiple coordination methods** - File-based, Git-based, MCP
   server integration
5. **Proven workflow patterns** - Developer → QA → DevOps delegation
   chains
6. **Token budget still matters** - But personas justify the cost
   through specialized efficiency

## MVP Scope (Updated - 6-8 weeks)

### Phase 1: Basic Generator (2 weeks)

1. **Basic configuration wizard** with 4-5 popular tech stacks
2. **Simple template system** with proven patterns
3. **Basic CLAUDE.md generation** following research-based best
   practices

### Phase 2: Persona Builder (3 weeks)

4. **Persona definition interface** with role selection
5. **Delegation rule configuration** for subagent coordination
6. **Advanced template system** with persona patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)

7. **Multi-agent workflow builder** with visual flow design
8. **Testing and simulation** capabilities
9. **Export functionality** with modular persona files

## Success Criteria for MVP

**Basic Features:**

- 100+ basic configurations generated in first month
- Positive user feedback on generated CLAUDE.md quality

**Advanced Features:**

- 50+ persona systems created in first 3 months
- Community adoption of multi-agent workflow patterns
- Clear improvement in complex project development efficiency

**Community Impact:**
