Unbreakable Rules:

- Use snake case for all variables and functions
- Use kebab case for all files and directories
- Files always have a blank line at the end
- Always write tests that test behavior, not the implementation
- Never mock in tests
- Small, pure, functions whenever possible
- Immutable values whenever possible
- Never take a shortcut
- Ultra think through problems before taking the hacky solution
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them
- Use DaisyUI components and classes for all UI styling
- Prefer semantic DaisyUI component classes over raw Tailwind
