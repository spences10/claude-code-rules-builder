# Getting Started: Using Your Generated CLAUDE.md File

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download Your CLAUDE.md File

After generating your CLAUDE.md file with our tool:

1. Click **Download** to save the file
2. Alternatively, use **Copy to Clipboard** for quick pasting

### Step 2: Install in Your Project

Place the CLAUDE.md file in your project root directory:

```bash
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md          # ← Your generated file goes here
├── package.json
├── src/
└── README.md
```

### Step 3: Start Claude Code

Navigate to your project directory and launch Claude Code:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

Claude Code will automatically discover and load your CLAUDE.md file,
providing instant project-aware assistance.

## File Hierarchy

Claude Code uses a cascading memory system that loads files in this
order:

### 1. Global Memory (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

Personal preferences that apply to all your projects:

```markdown
# Personal Development Preferences

- Prefer concise explanations over verbose ones
- Always suggest TypeScript over JavaScript when possible
- Use conventional commit message format
```

### 2. Project Memory (`./CLAUDE.md`)

Team-shared project instructions (your generated file):

```markdown
# Project Name

## Tech Stack

## Development Commands

## Code Style

## Project Structure
```

### 3. Local Memory (`./CLAUDE.local.md`) _[Deprecated]_

Use imports instead for personal project preferences.

## Validation Checklist

After installing your CLAUDE.md file, verify it's working correctly:

### ✅ Basic Validation

1. **File Discovery**: Claude Code mentions loading your CLAUDE.md on
   startup
2. **Command Recognition**: Ask Claude to run a build command - it
   should use your specified commands
3. **Style Awareness**: Request code changes - Claude should follow
   your defined style rules
4. **Structure Understanding**: Ask about project organization -
   Claude should reference your defined structure

### ✅ Advanced Validation (Persona Systems)

1. **Persona Selection**: Claude should ask which persona to adopt or
   automatically select appropriate ones
2. **Delegation**: When using multi-agent systems, Claude should
   properly delegate tasks to appropriate personas
3. **Workflow Adherence**: Personas should follow defined quality
   gates and validation steps
4. **Communication**: Multi-agent systems should coordinate through
   defined protocols

## Common Usage Patterns

### Basic Project Assistance

```
You: "Add a new React component for user profiles"

Claude: "I'll create a new React component following your TypeScript and
functional component preferences. Based on your project structure,
I'll place it in src/components/ and include proper props typing."
```

### Team Workflow Integration

```
You: "Review this pull request"

Claude: "Following your team's code review standards, I'll check for:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Test coverage for new functionality
- Adherence to your conventional commit format
- Proper documentation for public APIs"
```

### Persona System Usage

```
You: "I need to implement a new authentication system"

Claude: "I'm adopting the Architect persona to design the system architecture
first, then I'll delegate implementation to the Developer persona and
testing to the QA persona. Let me start with the architectural design..."
```

## Best Practices

### For Individual Developers

#### Keep It Current

- **Regular Updates**: Review and update your CLAUDE.md as your
  project evolves
- **Command Verification**: Ensure all listed commands still work
  correctly
- **Style Evolution**: Update code style rules as team preferences
  change

#### Optimize for Efficiency

- **Specific Commands**: Include exact commands with proper flags and
  options
- **Clear Structure**: Use bullet points and headers for easy scanning
- **Focus on Essentials**: Include only information Claude needs to
  know

### For Teams

#### Version Control Integration

```bash
# Include CLAUDE.md in your repository
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "feat: add Claude Code project memory"

# Keep personal preferences separate
echo "CLAUDE.local.md" >> .gitignore
```

#### Collaborative Maintenance

- **Code Review**: Include CLAUDE.md changes in pull request reviews
- **Team Input**: Gather feedback on AI assistance quality and adjust
  accordingly
- **Documentation**: Keep CLAUDE.md changes documented in commit
  messages

### For Advanced Users

#### Persona System Management

- **Role Clarity**: Ensure each persona has clearly defined
  responsibilities
- **Delegation Rules**: Test delegation patterns to ensure proper task
  routing
- **Communication Protocols**: Verify agent coordination works as
  expected
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track whether multi-agent workflows
  improve efficiency

#### Integration with Tools

```markdown
# Example: MCP Server Integration

## Available MCP Servers

- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation and testing
- **SQLite MCP**: Database operations and queries
- **Custom MCP**: Project-specific tool integration

## Persona-Tool Mapping

- Developer Persona → SQLite MCP for database changes
- QA Persona → Playwright MCP for end-to-end testing
- DevOps Persona → Custom MCP for deployment operations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CLAUDE.md Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Claude doesn't seem aware of your project configuration
**Solutions**:

1. Verify file is named exactly `CLAUDE.md` (case-sensitive)
2. Check file is in project root directory
3. Restart Claude Code session
4. Verify file has valid Markdown syntax

#### Inconsistent Behaviour

**Symptoms**: Claude sometimes ignores CLAUDE.md instructions
**Solutions**:

1. Use `/compact` command to manage memory usage
2. Make instructions more specific and actionable
3. Reduce file size if it's very large (>300 lines)
4. Test with simpler instructions first

#### Persona Conflicts

**Symptoms**: Multi-agent systems show confusing or conflicting
behaviour **Solutions**:

1. Verify persona selection rules are clear and unambiguous
2. Test delegation rules with simple tasks first
3. Check communication protocols are properly defined
4. Ensure quality gates are specific and testable

### Memory Management

#### File Size Optimization

- **Token Budget**: CLAUDE.md contents are prepended to every prompt
- **Cost Impact**: Larger files increase per-prompt costs
- **Optimal Range**: 25-250 lines for most projects
- **Modular Approach**: Use imports (`@filename.md`) for large
  configurations

#### Context Retention

```bash
# Use Claude Code's memory management commands
claude> /compact        # Compress memory usage
claude> /memory         # Edit memory files
claude> ccusage         # Check token consumption
```

## Advanced Features

### Import System

Create modular CLAUDE.md files using imports:

```markdown
# Main CLAUDE.md

This is the main project configuration.

@docs/coding-standards.md @team/workflow-guidelines.md  
@~/.claude/personal-preferences.md
```

### Dynamic Configuration

Update CLAUDE.md during development sessions:

```bash
# Quick additions during Claude Code session
claude> # Add new coding standard: prefer async/await over .then()

# This adds the comment to CLAUDE.md automatically
```

### Team Templates

Share CLAUDE.md templates across projects:

```bash
# Create organization template
cp project-template.md ~/.claude/templates/company-standard.md

# Use in new projects
cp ~/.claude/templates/company-standard.md ./CLAUDE.md
```

## Success Metrics

Track the effectiveness of your CLAUDE.md implementation:

### Individual Success Indicators

## Next Steps

### Iterate and Improve

1. **Monitor Usage**: Pay attention to which instructions are most
   helpful
2. **Gather Feedback**: If working in a team, collect input on AI
   assistance quality
3. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule monthly reviews of CLAUDE.md
   effectiveness
4. **Stay Updated**: Keep informed about new Claude Code features and
   capabilities
